# Allow Without Deny

_Gixy Check ID: `allow_without_deny`_


When a configuration block contains `allow` directive with some IP address or subnet, it most likely should also contain `deny all;` directive (or it should be enforced somewhere else).
**Otherwise, there's basically no access limitation.**

## Bad Example

```nginx
location / {
      root /var/www/;
      allow 10.0.0.0/8;
      . . .
}
```
